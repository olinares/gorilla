    Exceeded all expectations! My tech was cheerful, courteous, personable and knowledgable. Attempted to update my universal remote along with my Roku and royally botched it up. He fixed my issue with precision and a sense of humor.

    Unlike most techs that speak in tongues and make you feel like an idiot, my tech was super personable was able to fix my issue within an hour and even gave me some backup recommendations. Even his attire and demeanor was very confident yet easygoing!
