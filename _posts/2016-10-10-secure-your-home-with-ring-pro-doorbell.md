#### Installation

I will let you know that installation is usually a hit or miss experience. Sometimes installs are seamless sometimes you will have to tweak the kitchen sink. The process is to first install your power kit to your existing chime box inside your home. This will provide power to your Ring Doorbell as well as give you the ability to hear the doorbell inside your house. The next step is to install the actual doorbell in front of your home. This is usually an easy process since you just need to disconnect your old doorbell and connect the two cables to the back of your device. If all goes well and your device powers up, you will hear the audio prompts from your device and you can now open the Ring Doorbell app on your phone or tablet to start configuring.

Since your device runs on your existing home WiFi, you will want to have a good reception range for your device to work flawlessly.

As always, if you just do not want to deal with your home electrical wiring or simply need a professional to install it for you. You can always book one of our techs to perform the install for you today.
